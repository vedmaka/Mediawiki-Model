What is Model?
==============

Very simple and lightweight thing.
Model allows you use model-objects over Mediawiki DatabaseBase class.

**With Model you can focus on work with objects, not SQL-queries.**

```php
 $user = new Model_User();
 $user->password = '1234';
 $user->save();
```

To start using Model:

- include it in LocalSettings.php
- create model classes based on class Model with your model description
- create proper database tables
- use models in your code.

Read [documentation](http://github.com/vedmaka/Mediawiki-Model/wiki) for additional information.
